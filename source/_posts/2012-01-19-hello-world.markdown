Yeah, I know: the post title is over-used. But I like traditions.  
So... I'm Simone, 21. Currently I work at [Metwit](http://www.metwit.com) as COO.  

I used to be a blogger, but then I took an arrow to the knee.  
As a new year's resolution I promised myself to resume my writing job.  
After struggling for a while, finally I came up with a cool name for the new one... and here we are.

I like books, movies and all the IT stuff. I know when the narwhal does bacon.  
Hope you'll enjoy the show.
